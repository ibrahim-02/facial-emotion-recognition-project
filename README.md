Facial Emotion Recognition with Deep Learning
This project is designed to recognize emotions from facial expressions using deep learning techniques. The project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on the FER2013 dataset and integrates real-time emotion recognition through a webcam.

Overview
This project consists of two primary components:

Emotion Recognition Model:

Trains a CNN using the FER2013 dataset to classify emotions.
Handles data preprocessing and model training.
Video Tester:

Captures real-time video input through a webcam.
Detects faces using Haar cascades and predicts emotions using the trained model.
Features
Emotion recognition from real-time video feeds.
Pre-trained deep learning model for emotion classification.
Support for detecting multiple faces in a frame.
User-friendly integration with OpenCV for webcam usage.
Technologies Used
Python: Programming language.
Keras: Deep learning library for building and training the model.
OpenCV: Real-time face detection and video processing.
NumPy: Numerical computations.
Pandas: Dataset handling and preprocessing.
Setup and Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/ibrahim-02/facial-emotion-recognition.git
Install required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the required files:

FER2013 dataset for training.


Usage
Train the Model
Run the emotion_recognition.py file to train the model:
bash
Copy code
python emotion_recognition.py
This script will preprocess the dataset, build the CNN model, and save the trained weights.
Real-Time Emotion Detection
Run the video_tester.py file to test real-time emotion detection:
bash
Copy code
python video_tester.py
The webcam feed will open, and detected faces will be annotated with their predicted emotions.
